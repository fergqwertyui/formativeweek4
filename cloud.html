        <p>This website was put together using GitHub, a cloud based application that utilises Git <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8739/16284069063_9b16b170f2_b.jpg" alt="Picture Respresenting Cloud Computing" class="w-25 h-25 float-end" id="CloudIMG"></p>
        <p>Cloud based services allow you to store and access files remotely and without needing to download them to a local storage; assuming you have access to the internet.</p>
        <p>Many things in day to day life utilise "The Cloud", such as: <ul>
                                                                          <li class="ms-5">Social Media</li>

                                                                        </ul></p>

        <h4>Keeping us connected during the pandemic</h4>
        <p>Cloud Computing allowed transition of work from in person to remote during the pandemic: it allows work to be stored and accessed remotely, away from the office; aswell as allowing people to meet virtually, bringing the office to your home or allwoing children to be schooled and educated remotely.</p>
        <p>Remote work has become part of the new normal and has become a much more common and prominent requriement for jobs seekers. Pushing more utility to the progress of cloud based services</p>
        <p>Kept families and friends together when they couldnt see each other, by letting people see and chat with their friends without leaving the house</p>
    </div>

    <div class="row mx-5">
      <h4>Software</h4>
      <p>Cloud based services allow for software applications to be downloaded and updated remotely from an internet browser, instead of needing to be manually installed from a drive or disc</p>
      <p>Much more convenient as allows everyone, anywhere access to the applications. Especially useful for applications that may recieve frequent updates, ie. Video Games or Anti-Virus Software</p>
      <p>Also helps to store photos, videos and messages without needing them physcially written to your hardware. Saving people needing a huge amount of physical memory.</p>
